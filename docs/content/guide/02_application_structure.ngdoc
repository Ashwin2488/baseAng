#Angular structure guideline

###Grouping the application into logical units

 We group the components,sub-sections of the application into logical units under the modules folder.
 Each component may contain module definition,services,directives,html css files or filters specific to it.
 Each component may have sub section with the same structure as the components depending upon the complexity of the UI.
 
```
modules
	home/
		home.tpl.html
		home-controller.js
		home-controller_test.js
		home-service.js
	page1/
		........
		........
	page2/
		........
		........
app.js
app.css
index.html
				
``` 
###Naming conventions
We also have to follow some naming conventions that would be helpfull to easily maintain the app when it scales.
Google recommended naming conventions for angular app are as follows

- Each filename should describe the file's purpose by including the component or view sub-section 
  that it's in, and the type of object that it is as part of the name. For example, a datepicker directive 
  would be in components/datepicker/datepicker-directive.js.
  
- Controllers, Directives, Services, and Filters, should include controller, directive, service, and filter in their name.

- File names should be lowercase, following the existing JS Style recommendations. HTML and css files should also be lowercase.

- Unit tests should be named ending in _test.js, hence  "foo-controller_test.js" and "bar-directive_test.js"

- Modules should be named with lowerCamelCase. For indicating that module b is submodule of module a you can nest 
  them by using namespacing like: a.b

- The naming of the controller is done using the controller's functionality (for example shopping cart, homepage, admin panel)
  and the substring Ctrl in the end. The controllers are named UpperCamelCase (HomePageCtrl, ShoppingCartCtrl, AdminPanelCtrl, etc.).
  
- Name your directives with lowerCamelCase.Use custom prefixes for your directives to prevent name collisions with third-party libraries.

- Name your filters with lowerCamelCase.

- Use camelCase to name your services.
